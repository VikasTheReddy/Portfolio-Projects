Hospital Management System

A MySQL-based database system designed to manage hospital operations, including patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, and treatments. This project showcases my skills in database design, normalization, and triggers, developed as part of my coursework at NIT Warangal.
Features

Normalized Database: Structured tables for patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments, adhering to 3NF to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.

Foreign Key Constraints: Ensures relational integrity across tables (e.g., linking appointments to patients and doctors).

Appointment Limit Trigger: Prevents doctors from having more than 10 appointments per day, enhancing scheduling efficiency.

Diagnosis Report Query: Generates reports of patients diagnosed with specific diseases, improving data accessibility for hospital staff.

Future Improvements :
Add stored procedures for common operations (e.g., scheduling appointments).
Implement a simple front-end interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to interact with the database.
Expand the diagnosis report to include additional filters (e.g., date ranges).
